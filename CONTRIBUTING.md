## Getting Started
- Please read the **[README.md](/README.md)** first for project overview and setup.
- If offered, use our **ISSUE_TEMPLATE** or **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE** to structure your contributions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Use the **Bug Report** template, describing:
    - Version
    - Expected vs. actual behavior
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Environment

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Use the **Enhancement Request** template with:
    - Purpose & benefit
    - Proposed behavior or API
    - Any mockups or examples

### Submitting Code
1. Fork the repository and create your branch (`feature/xyz` or `fix/abc`).
2. Ensure your changes follow our style guidelines.
3. Run tests and make sure they pass.
4. Submit a PR against `master`, referencing relevant issues.
5. Wait for review—be open to feedback and happy to iterate!

## Coding Style & Commit Guidelines
- Keep code style consistent with existing patterns.
- Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages
- Stick to present tense in commit messages, e.g. `"feat: add parsing for new command"` not `"Added parsing"`.
- Limit the first commit message line to ~50 characters; more detail can go in the body.

## Testing
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Run `gradlew test` before submitting.

## Issue & PR Templates
We provide templates to help structure issues and PRs—make use of them!

## Labels & Issues
- Use labels like `good first issue` or `help wanted` to find tasks suited to your experience level.
